# XenForo2-CanWarnStaff

Allow moderators and administrators to be warned, and designated bless groups not to be warned.

AdminCP access can obviously bypass any warning issued, and warnings themselves can be edited or deleted depending on permissions for the user.

Allows staff to be reply banned, and introduces permissions controlling if moderators/administrators can be reply banned.

Introduces 7 new permissions:

- Give moderators warnings directly. (Applys to thread reply bans)
- Give administrators warnings directly. (Applys to thread reply bans)
- Delete all warnings for Moderators. (Applys to thread reply bans)
- Delete all warnings for Administrators. (Applys to thread reply bans)
- Prevent posts being warned.
- Prevent being directly warned.
- Prevent profile posts being warned.
